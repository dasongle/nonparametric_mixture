          Video-to-video means that both gallery and probe consists
          of videos. We model a moving face as a linear dynamical
          system whose appearance changes with pose. An
          autoregressive and moving average (ARMA) model is used to
          represent such a system. The choice of ARMA model is based
          on its ability to take care of the change in appearance
          while modeling the dynamics of pose, expression etc},

  abstract  = {We bound the future loss when predicting any (computably)
          stochastic sequence online. Solomonoff finitely bounded the
          total deviation of his universal predictor $M$ from the
          true distribution $mu$ by the algorithmic complexity of
          $mu$. Here we assume we are at a time $t>1$ and already
          observed $x=x_1...x_t$. We bound the future prediction
          performance on $x_{t+1}x_{t+2}...$ by a new variant of
          algorithmic complexity of $mu$ given $x$, plus the
          complexity of the randomness deficiency of $x$. The new
          complexity is monotone in its condition in the sense that
          this complexity can only decrease if the condition is
          prolonged. We also briefly discuss potential
          generalizations to Bayesian model classes and to
          classification problems.},

  abstract  = {The ability to predict protein function from structure is
          becoming increasingly important as the number of structures
          resolved is growing more rapidly than our capacity to study
          function. Current methods for predicting protein function
          are mostly reliant on identifying a similar protein of
          known function. For proteins that are highly dissimilar or
          are only similar to proteins also lacking functional
          annotations, these methods fail. Here, we show that protein
          function can be predicted as enzymatic or not without
          resorting to alignments. We describe 1178 high-resolution
          proteins in a structurally non-redundant subset of the
          Protein Data Bank using simple features such as
          secondary-structure content, amino acid propensities,
          surface properties and ligands. The subset is split into
          two functional groupings, enzymes and non-enzymes. We use
          the support vector machine-learning algorithm to develop
          models that are capable of assigning the protein class.
          Validation of the method shows that the function can be
          predicted to an accuracy of 77\% using 52 features to
          describe each protein. An adaptive search of possible
          subsets of features produces a simplified model based on 36
          features that predicts at an accuracy of 80\%. We compare
          the method to sequence-based methods that also avoid
          calculating alignments and predict a recently released set
          of unrelated proteins. The most useful features for
          distinguishing enzymes from non-enzymes are
          secondary-structure content, amino acid frequencies, number
          of disulphide bonds and size of the largest cleft. This
          method is applicable to any structure as it does not
          require the identification of sequence or structural
          similarity to a protein of known function.},

  abstract  = {Supervised Learning in Multi-Layered Neural Networks
          (MLNs) has been recently proposed through the well-known
          Backpropagation algorithm. This is a gradient method which
          can get stuck in local minima, as simple examples can show.
          In this paper, some conditions on the network architecture
          and the learning environment are proposed which ensure the
          convergence of the Backpropagation algorithm. It is proven
          in particular that the convergence holds if the classes are
          linearly-separable. In this case, the experience gained in
          several experiments shows that $MLNs$ exceed perceptrons in
          generalization to new examples.},

          posterior mu, if the latter is computable. Hence, M is
          eligible as a universal sequence predictor in case of
          unknown mu. Despite some nearby results and proofs in the
          literature, the stronger result of convergence for all
          (Martin-Loef) random sequences remained open. Such a
          convergence result would be particularly interesting and
          natural, since randomness can be defined in terms of M
          itself. We show that there are universal semimeasures M
          which do not converge for all random sequences, i.e. we
          give a partial negative answer to the open problem. We also
          provide a positive answer for some non-universal
          semimeasures. We define the incomputable measure D as a
          mixture over all computable measures and the enumerable
          semimeasure W as a mixture over all enumerable
          nearly-measures. We show that W converges to D and D to mu
          on all random sequences. The Hellinger distance measuring
          closeness of two distributions plays a central role.},

          framework for inductive reasoning, which includes
          hypothesis testing and confirmation, parameter estimation,
          sequence prediction, classification, and regression. But
          standard statistical guidelines for choosing the model
          class and prior are not always available or fail, in
          particular in complex situations. Solomonoff completed the
          Bayesian framework by providing a rigorous, unique, formal,
          and universal choice for the model class and the prior. We
          discuss in breadth how and in which sense universal
          (non-i.i.d.) sequence prediction solves various
          (philosophical) problems of traditional Bayesian sequence
          prediction. We show that Solomonoff's model possesses many
          desirable properties: Strong total and weak instantaneous
          bounds, and in contrast to most classical continuous prior
          densities has no zero p(oste)rior problem, i.e. can confirm
          universal hypotheses, is reparametrization and regrouping
          invariant, and avoids the old-evidence and updating
          problem. It even performs well (actually better) in
          non-computable environments.}

  abstract  = {We derive an exact and efficient Bayesian regression
          algorithm for piecewise constant functions of unknown
          segment number, boundary location, and levels. It works for
          any noise and segment level prior, e.g.\ Cauchy which can
          handle outliers. We derive simple but good estimates for
          the in-segment variance. We also propose a Bayesian
          regression curve as a better way of smoothing data without
          blurring boundaries. The Bayesian approach also allows
          straightforward determination of the evidence, break
          probabilities and error estimates, useful for model
          selection and significance and robustness studies. We
          briefly mention the performance on synthetic and real-world
          examples. The full version of the paper contains detailed
          derivations, more motivation and discussion, the complete
          algorithm, the experiments, and various extensions.},

           the number of neighbors to be averaged over in k nearest

          regression with polynomials. We suggest a novel principle
          (LoRP) for model selection in regression and

          how many other (fictitious) data would be fitted better.
          LoRP selects the model that has minimal loss rank. Unlike
          most penalized maximum likelihood variants (AIC,BIC,MDL),
          LoRP only depends on the regression functions and the loss
          function. It works without a stochastic noise model, and is
          directly applicable to any non-parametric regressor, like
          kNN.},

          the most important concepts. AIT arises by mixing
          information theory and computation theory to obtain an
          objective and absolute notion of information in an
          individual object, and in so doing gives rise to an
          objective and robust notion of randomness of individual
          objects. This is in contrast to classical information
          theory that is based on random variables and communication,
          and has no bearing on information and randomness of
          individual objects. After a brief overview, the major

          agents in uncertain worlds if the true environmental prior
          probability distribution is known. Solomonoff's theory of
          universal induction formally solves the problem of sequence
          prediction for unknown prior distribution. We combine both
          ideas and get a parameter-free theory of universal
          Artificial Intelligence. We give strong arguments that the
          resulting AIXI model is the most intelligent unbiased agent
          possible. We outline for a number of problem classes,
          including sequence prediction, strategic games, function
          minimization, reinforcement and supervised learning, how
          the AIXI model can formally solve them. The major drawback
          of the AIXI model is that it is uncomputable. To overcome
          this problem, we construct a modified algorithm AIXI$tl$
          that is still effectively more intelligent than any other
          time $t$ and length $l$ bounded agent. The computation time
          of AIXI$tl$ is of the order $t \cdot 2^l$. Other discussed
          topics are formal definitions of intelligence order
          relations, the horizon problem and relations of the AIXI
          theory to other AI approaches.}

          nobody really knows what intelligence is. The problem is
          especially acute when we need to consider artificial
          systems which are significantly different to humans. In
          this paper we approach this problem in the following way:
          We take a number of well known informal definitions of
          human intelligence that have been given by experts, and
          extract their essential features. These are then
          mathematically formalised to produce a general measure of
          intelligence for arbitrary machines. We believe that this
          equation formally captures the concept of machine
          intelligence in the broadest reasonable sense. We then show
          how this formal definition is related to the theory of
          universal optimal learning agents. Finally, we survey the
          many other tests and definitions of intelligence that have
          been proposed for machines.},

  abstract  = {We consider the problem of multiclass classification. Our
          main thesis is that a simple "one-vs-all" scheme is as
          accurate as any other approach, assuming that the
          underlying binary classifiers are well-tuned regularized
          classifiers such as support vector machines. This thesis is
          interesting in that it disagrees with a large body of
          recent published work on multiclass classification. We
          support our position by means of a critical review of the
          existing literature, a substantial collection of carefully
          controlled experimental work, and theoretical arguments.},

  abstract  = {Suppose we are given two probability measures on the set
          of one-way infinite finite-alphabet sequences. Consider the
          question when one of the measures predicts the other, that
          is, when conditional probabilities converge (in a certain
          sense), if one of the measures is chosen to generate the
          sequence. This question may be considered a refinement of
          the problem of sequence prediction in its most general
          formulation: for a given class of probability measures,
          does there exist a measure which predicts all of the
          measures in the class? To address this problem, we find
          some conditions on local absolute continuity which are
          sufficient for prediction and generalize several different
          notions that are known to be sufficient for prediction. We
          also formulate some open questions to outline a direction
          for finding the conditions on classes of measures for which
          prediction is possible.},
