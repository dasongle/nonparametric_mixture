	Abstract = {The paper poses video-to-video face recognition as a
                  dynamical system identification and classification
                  problem.  Video-to-video means that both gallery and
                  probe consists of videos. We model a moving face as
                  a linear dynamical system whose appearance changes
                  with pose. An autoregressive and moving average
                  (ARMA) model is used to represent such a system. The
                  choice of ARMA model is based on its ability to take
                  care of the change in appearance while modeling the
                  dynamics of pose, expression etc},

	Abstract = {We bound the future loss when predicting any
                  (computably) stochastic sequence online. Solomonoff
                  finitely bounded the total deviation of his
                  universal predictor $M$ from the true distribution
                  $mu$ by the algorithmic complexity of $mu$. Here we
                  assume we are at a time $t>1$ and already observed
                  $x=x_1...x_t$. We bound the future prediction
                  performance on $x_{t+1}x_{t+2}...$ by a new variant
                  of algorithmic complexity of $mu$ given $x$, plus
                  the complexity of the randomness deficiency of
                  $x$. The new complexity is monotone in its condition
                  in the sense that this complexity can only decrease
                  if the condition is prolonged. We also briefly
                  discuss potential generalizations to Bayesian model
                  classes and to classification problems.},

	Abstract = {The ability to predict protein function from
                  structure is becoming increasingly important as the
                  number of structures resolved is growing more
                  rapidly than our capacity to study function. Current
                  methods for predicting protein function are mostly
                  reliant on identifying a similar protein of known
                  function. For proteins that are highly dissimilar or
                  are only similar to proteins also lacking functional
                  annotations, these methods fail. Here, we show that
                  protein function can be predicted as enzymatic or
                  not without resorting to alignments. We describe
                  1178 high-resolution proteins in a structurally
                  non-redundant subset of the Protein Data Bank using
                  simple features such as secondary-structure content,
                  amino acid propensities, surface properties and
                  ligands. The subset is split into two functional
                  groupings, enzymes and non-enzymes. We use the
                  support vector machine-learning algorithm to develop
                  models that are capable of assigning the protein
                  class.  Validation of the method shows that the
                  function can be predicted to an accuracy of 77\%
                  using 52 features to describe each protein. An
                  adaptive search of possible subsets of features
                  produces a simplified model based on 36 features
                  that predicts at an accuracy of 80\%. We compare the
                  method to sequence-based methods that also avoid
                  calculating alignments and predict a recently
                  released set of unrelated proteins. The most useful
                  features for distinguishing enzymes from non-enzymes
                  are secondary-structure content, amino acid
                  frequencies, number of disulphide bonds and size of
                  the largest cleft. This method is applicable to any
                  structure as it does not require the identification
                  of sequence or structural similarity to a protein of
                  known function.},

	Abstract = {Supervised Learning in Multi-Layered Neural Networks
                  (MLNs) has been recently proposed through the
                  well-known Backpropagation algorithm. This is a
                  gradient method which can get stuck in local minima,
                  as simple examples can show.  In this paper, some
                  conditions on the network architecture and the
                  learning environment are proposed which ensure the
                  convergence of the Backpropagation algorithm. It is
                  proven in particular that the convergence holds if
                  the classes are linearly-separable. In this case,
                  the experience gained in several experiments shows
                  that $MLNs$ exceed perceptrons in generalization to
                  new examples.},

	Abstract = {Solomonoff's central result on induction is that the
                  posterior of a universal semimeasure M converges
                  rapidly and with probability 1 to the true sequence
                  generating posterior mu, if the latter is
                  computable. Hence, M is eligible as a universal
                  sequence predictor in case of unknown mu. Despite
                  some nearby results and proofs in the literature,
                  the stronger result of convergence for all
                  (Martin-Loef) random sequences remained open. Such a
                  convergence result would be particularly interesting
                  and natural, since randomness can be defined in
                  terms of M itself. We show that there are universal
                  semimeasures M which do not converge for all random
                  sequences, i.e. we give a partial negative answer to
                  the open problem. We also provide a positive answer
                  for some non-universal semimeasures. We define the
                  incomputable measure D as a mixture over all
                  computable measures and the enumerable semimeasure W
                  as a mixture over all enumerable nearly-measures. We
                  show that W converges to D and D to mu on all random
                  sequences. The Hellinger distance measuring
                  closeness of two distributions plays a central
                  role.},

	Abstract = {The Bayesian framework is a well-studied and
                  successful framework for inductive reasoning, which
                  includes hypothesis testing and confirmation,
                  parameter estimation, sequence prediction,
                  classification, and regression. But standard
                  statistical guidelines for choosing the model class
                  and prior are not always available or fail, in
                  particular in complex situations. Solomonoff
                  completed the Bayesian framework by providing a
                  rigorous, unique, formal, and universal choice for
                  the model class and the prior. We discuss in breadth
                  how and in which sense universal (non-i.i.d.)
                  sequence prediction solves various (philosophical)
                  problems of traditional Bayesian sequence
                  prediction. We show that Solomonoff's model
                  possesses many desirable properties: Strong total
                  and weak instantaneous bounds, and in contrast to
                  most classical continuous prior densities has no
                  zero p(oste)rior problem, i.e. can confirm universal
                  hypotheses, is reparametrization and regrouping
                  invariant, and avoids the old-evidence and updating
                  problem. It even performs well (actually better) in

	Abstract = {A key issue in statistics and machine learning is to
                  automatically select the ``right'' model complexity,
                  e.g.\ the number of neighbors to be averaged over in
                  k nearest neighbor (kNN) regression or the
                  polynomial degree in regression with polynomials. We
                  suggest a novel principle (LoRP) for model selection
                  in regression and classification. It is based on the
                  loss rank, which counts how many other (fictitious)
                  data would be fitted better.  LoRP selects the model
                  that has minimal loss rank. Unlike most penalized
                  maximum likelihood variants (AIC,BIC,MDL), LoRP only
                  depends on the regression functions and the loss
                  function. It works without a stochastic noise model,
                  and is directly applicable to any non-parametric

                  algorithmic information theory (AIT), its underlying
                  philosophy, and the most important concepts. AIT
                  arises by mixing information theory and computation
                  theory to obtain an objective and absolute notion of
                  information in an individual object, and in so doing
                  gives rise to an objective and robust notion of
                  randomness of individual objects. This is in
                  contrast to classical information theory that is
                  based on random variables and communication, and has
                  no bearing on information and randomness of
                  individual objects. After a brief overview, the

	Abstract = {Decision theory formally solves the problem of
                  rational agents in uncertain worlds if the true
                  environmental prior probability distribution is
                  known. Solomonoff's theory of universal induction
                  formally solves the problem of sequence prediction
                  for unknown prior distribution. We combine both
                  ideas and get a parameter-free theory of universal
                  Artificial Intelligence. We give strong arguments
                  that the resulting AIXI model is the most
                  intelligent unbiased agent possible. We outline for
                  a number of problem classes, including sequence
                  prediction, strategic games, function minimization,
                  reinforcement and supervised learning, how the AIXI
                  model can formally solve them. The major drawback of
                  the AIXI model is that it is uncomputable. To
                  overcome this problem, we construct a modified
                  algorithm AIXI$tl$ that is still effectively more
                  intelligent than any other time $t$ and length $l$
                  bounded agent. The computation time of AIXI$tl$ is
                  of the order $t \cdot 2^l$. Other discussed topics
                  are formal definitions of intelligence order
                  relations, the horizon problem and relations of the
                  AIXI theory to other AI approaches.},

                  intelligence exists. Indeed few researchers are even
                  aware of alternatives to the Turing test and its
                  many derivatives. In this paper we fill this gap by
                  providing a short survey of the many tests of

@article{LegHut07b,
	Abstract = {A fundamental problem in artificial intelligence is
                  that nobody really knows what intelligence is. The
                  problem is especially acute when we need to consider
                  artificial systems which are significantly different
                  to humans. In this paper we approach this problem in
                  the following way: We take a number of well known
                  informal definitions of human intelligence that have
                  been given by experts, and extract their essential
                  features. These are then mathematically formalised
                  to produce a general measure of intelligence for
                  arbitrary machines. We believe that this equation
                  formally captures the concept of machine
                  intelligence in the broadest reasonable sense. We
                  then show how this formal definition is related to
                  the theory of universal optimal learning
                  agents. Finally, we survey the many other tests and
                  definitions of intelligence that have been proposed
                  for machines.},

	Abstract = {We consider the problem of multiclass
                  classification. Our main thesis is that a simple
                  "one-vs-all" scheme is as accurate as any other
                  approach, assuming that the underlying binary
                  classifiers are well-tuned regularized classifiers
                  such as support vector machines. This thesis is
                  interesting in that it disagrees with a large body
                  of recent published work on multiclass
                  classification. We support our position by means of
                  a critical review of the existing literature, a
                  substantial collection of carefully controlled
                  experimental work, and theoretical arguments.},

	Abstract = {Suppose we are given two probability measures on the
                  set of one-way infinite finite-alphabet
                  sequences. Consider the question when one of the
                  measures predicts the other, that is, when
                  conditional probabilities converge (in a certain
                  sense), if one of the measures is chosen to generate
                  the sequence. This question may be considered a
                  refinement of the problem of sequence prediction in
                  its most general formulation: for a given class of
                  probability measures, does there exist a measure
                  which predicts all of the measures in the class? To
                  address this problem, we find some conditions on
                  local absolute continuity which are sufficient for
                  prediction and generalize several different notions
                  that are known to be sufficient for prediction. We
                  also formulate some open questions to outline a
                  direction for finding the conditions on classes of
                  measures for which prediction is possible.},
