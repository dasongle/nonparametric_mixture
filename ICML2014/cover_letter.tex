\section*{Cover Letter}

Dear program chairs and reviewers,

We would like to acknowledge anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments on our paper ``nonparametric estimation of multi-view latent variable models''. We have revised it based on these suggestions. Please find our major changes and the answers to their questions below.


\section*{List of Major Changes}

\begin{itemize}
\item[1] We rewrite the introduction part to make our problem setting clear and emphasize the novelty.
\item[2] We explain the extraction form of conditional density from Hilbert space embedding.
\item[3] We add more discussions on the sample complexity. The bound for integral and the conditional density recovery error bound under unsupervised setting is derived based on the main theorem.
\item[4] We add discussion on generalizing our method to nonlinear independent component analysis and latent variable models with Dirichlet priors.
\item[5] We add more competitors on both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets.
\end{itemize}

\section*{To Meta-Reviwer}
A discussion about the difference between the proposed method to previous related work are added. We compare the proposed method to more competitors on both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets to strengthen the experiments.
